Service Lifetime

*** Singleton ***
-Same instance for the life time of application unless it is restarted
-Should be used very carefully
-services.AddSingleton<>
-it sends same instance every time it is requested for.it will only change when application is restart

*** Scoped ***
- Same instance for one scope(One request in most cases).
- services.AddScoped<>
- Not ideal for multi threading 
- Sends a new instance for each request
- if you click on a view or link for that page load if instance is requested 10 times it will send same object


*** Transient *** 
- Different instance every time the service is injected.
- services.AddTransient<>
- Transient service sends a new instance every time it is requested
- if you click on a view or link for that page load if instance is requested 10 10 times it will send 10 different objects
